>### About
I am a beginner JS developer. Studying several IT courses. Have little experience in testing, coding, gamedev, web developing.\
\
I am a sociable, broad-minded person with organizing skills. Able to find my way to almost everybody. Looking for a stable working environment with a developed community where I can grow myself up, implement my personality and improve the quality of life for my family.\
\
I am thirsty for knowledge and never stopped learning something new. My goal is to become a real master in the field of information technologies and bring value to my company and the whole community.\
